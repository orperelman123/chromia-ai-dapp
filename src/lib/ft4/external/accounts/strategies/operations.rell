/**
 * An operation which can be called to create an account. This operation is part
 * of the account registration framework and it must be preceded by a strategy
 * operation which contains information about how the account is supposed to 
 * be registered.
 * 
 * Throws if the operation that came just before this one cannot be handled. Common cases are:
 * - the operation is not registered as a strategy operation through extensions of `strategy`
 * - the operation has been misconfigured, and its name does not match the operation mount name
 * 
 * Throws if the signature verification is unsuccessful. Common cases are:
 * - `evm_signatures` is misconfigured:
 *   - any of the signers and signatures don't match in the exact order they're found
 *   - any of the signatures is null
 *   - there's more signatures than signers
 * - a signature from one of the auth descriptor participants is missing:
 *   - an EVM signer is specified but the signature is not found in `evm_signatures`
 *   - an FT signer is specified but the signature is not in the transaction
 *   - a signer passed is neither an EVM nor an FT signer (its length does not match either of
 *     `core.auth.EVM_ADDRESS_SIZE` and `core.auth.FT_PUBKEY_SIZE`)
 *
 * Throws if either auth descriptor is invalid. Common cases include:
 * - the main auth descriptor has expiration rules instead of `core.accounts.GTV_NULL`
 * - the disposable auth descriptor's expiration rules:
 *   - is a complex rule with too many rule components
 *   - has already expired
 *   - is not the valid GTV representation of a rule
 * - errors with the `args` field:
 *   - some required flags are missing
 *   - in multi-sig auth descriptors, the `required_signatures` field:
 *     - is 0 or less
 *     - is greater than the number of signers
 * 
 * Throws if `core.accounts.AUTH_DESCRIPTORS_PER_ACCOUNT_UPPER_BOUND` is set to 1 and
 * `disposable` passed to the strategy operation is not null.
 * 
 * Throws if some conditions added in development through extensions (`before_register_account`
 * or `after_register_account`) aren't met
 * 
 * @see core.accounts.strategies.register_account for information on how to use this operation
